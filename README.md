# Tree Canopy Classification

This project leverages advanced machine learning techniques and geospatial data to classify tree canopy coverage from satellite imagery. It is designed for researchers, urban planners, and environmentalists to assess urban greenery and support sustainability initiatives.

## Features
- **Image Classification**: Analyze satellite images to identify areas with tree canopy coverage.
- **Geospatial Integration**: Utilize geospatial data for accurate mapping and analysis.
- **Interactive Visualization**: Display results with overlays and classified segments for better insights.
- **Performance Metrics**: Evaluate the model with precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Technology Stack
- **Backend Framework**: Python with Flask
- **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow/Keras for deep learning models
- **Geospatial Tools**: GDAL, GeoPandas
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Plotly
- **Data Processing**: NumPy, Pandas
